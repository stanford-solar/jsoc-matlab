# JSOC Matlab Scripts

This repository hosts Matlab oriented scripts to access
[JSOC](http://jsoc.stanford.edu) data via Matlab.

The included PDF details how to use these scripts to access the data.

Development is currently limited on these scripts as the preferred method for
accessing data is through export requests at
http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/exportdata.html
